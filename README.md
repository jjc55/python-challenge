Module 3 Challenge: Python

I practiced my python coding skills for the module 3 challenge. This challenge consisted of two subprojects: PyBank and PyPoll. In PyBank project, we were given a CSV file holding financial information. Using python, I analyzed this financial dataset to find profits, losses, etc. In the PyPoll project, I was given a CSV file hold election information, specifically votes per candidate in a small town. For this project, I calculated the number of votes different candidates recieved and calculated the election winner.
